# Qubic Proposal

## Overview

This proposal covers **two complementary projects** that strengthen the Qubic ecosystem:

1. [Qubic Smart Contract Documentation](#qubic-smart-contract-documentation)  
2. [Qubic Core Lite](#qubic-core-lite)  

Both projects are led by **@feiyuiv** and aim to lower the entry barrier for developers, improve ecosystem adoption, and provide essential tools and resources for the Qubic community.  

**Total Funding Request:** **$25k**
